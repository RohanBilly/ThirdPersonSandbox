# Gameplay Programming - Third Person Sandbox

This was a university project for the Gameplay Programming module, a Third Person Platformer Game Sandbox developed using Unity.

## Things I learned

- Using git in a Unity project

## Demonstration Level

To play the demonstration level, run the file ThirdPersonSandbox.exe in the Build folder.
